# LearningNodeJs

  This is my study about NODEJS, Here I show some lessons I've learned from rocketseat bootcamp. 
  *This repository is for node learning only
> If you've any questions call me for my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinicius-leonardo-okamoto-795610190/) I'll help with what I can!!!

## Getting Started
  Here you'll find some knowledge about relational, nonrelational, send queues, middleware, controllers, REST API all on node js. This repository will have 2 projects, one having api introduction without database, the other an application called gobarber with the above mentioned items.
  All projects are documented and easy to understand.
  
### Prerequisites
  You'll need NODE and YARN installed in your computer. These sites will help you with the installation and configures around my projects
* [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/docs/install#windows-stable)

### Installing

Basically, with the prerequisites installed, you'll need only configure the databases... to install the packages you must use the command "yarn" or "npm i"
