  *This repository is for node learning only
> If you've any questions call me for my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinicius-leonardo-okamoto-795610190/) I'll help with what I can!!!

## Getting Started
  Here you'll find some knowledge about relational, nonrelational, send queues, middleware, controllers, REST API all on node js. This repository will have 2 projects, one having api introduction without database, the other an application called gobarber with the above mentioned items.
